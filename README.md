# The A.M.a.D.E.U.S. (<u>A</u>ppropriately <u>M</u>enial <u>a</u>nd <u>D</u>eployable <u>E</u>asily <u>U</u>nderstandable <u>S</u>ample) Project

Often times I find myself in need of a simple example project to use to test some other external system.
I'm bored of re-writing that project, so I'm just going to put it in a GH repo now.


This project uses CMake in order to provide a two-step build process for slightly more complexity (and thus, testable behaviour).
The actual program is a simple number guessing game.


Feel free to use as needed.
